-- Final fix for rooms table to support wallet users
-- This migration avoids all UUID/TEXT comparison issues

-- First, drop the foreign key constraint if it exists
ALTER TABLE rooms 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS rooms_creator_id_fkey;

-- Add columns if they don't exist
ALTER TABLE rooms 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS creator_wallet TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS description TEXT;

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rooms_creator_id ON rooms(creator_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rooms_creator_wallet ON rooms(creator_wallet);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rooms_external_id_unique ON rooms(external_id);

-- Drop all existing RLS policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create rooms" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their rooms" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view rooms" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their rooms" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their rooms" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can create rooms" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view rooms" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Room creators can update" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Room creators can delete" ON rooms;

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE rooms ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create simple, permissive policies without type comparisons
-- These policies rely on application-level security

-- Allow anyone to create rooms
CREATE POLICY "Allow room creation" ON rooms
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow anyone to view rooms (we'll filter in the application)
CREATE POLICY "Allow room viewing" ON rooms
FOR SELECT 
USING (true);

-- Allow anyone to update rooms (we'll verify ownership in the application)
CREATE POLICY "Allow room updates" ON rooms
FOR UPDATE 
USING (true);

-- Allow anyone to delete rooms (we'll verify ownership in the application)
CREATE POLICY "Allow room deletion" ON rooms
FOR DELETE 
USING (true);

-- Add helpful comments
COMMENT ON COLUMN rooms.creator_id IS 'Can be either a UUID (for auth users) or wallet address (for wallet users)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN rooms.creator_wallet IS 'Stores the wallet address if the creator is using wallet authentication';
COMMENT ON TABLE rooms IS 'Rooms table supports both traditional auth users and wallet-based users';
